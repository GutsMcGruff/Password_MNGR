--- Password MNGR ---

Password MNGR is a python console based password vault with support for multiple users. The project contains a user login system 
with user passwords hashed and salted to resist database attacks. The password vault is encrypted with a symetrical password 
based encryption algorithm with keys derived with PBKDF2. Additional features include automatic random password generation of
specified length and password validation to ensure passwords have enough entropy to resist brute force, rainbow table and 
dictionary attacks.
